# Beekeeper's Journal E-Shop

Buy the best Organic Honey from beautiful Gippsland, Victoria

---------


## Business case

Beekeeper's Journal is a family-run business with local outreach and tailored produce.

The business solution offered is to use Next.js for its static and ssr capabilities. To keep the costs low, the backend will be served by Strapi as a headless CMS.


--------

## NextJS advantages:
For this project, I chose to use Next's incremental static regeneration strategy for fetching the products from the CMS



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Tech stack:
  - Next.js v13
  - Typescript
  - CSS by Tailwind
  - Strapi v4 as CMS
  - React Query [https://react-query.tanstack.com](https://react-query.tanstack.com)


## Development plan
Having the basics, the plan is to:
- Implement the shopping cart
- Allow new users to register to the page
- Allow users to reset their password
- Double check security standards of the api endpoints
- Deploy Front and CMS
- Allow users to make payments (Research pathways)
- Style the site
- Brand the site


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
